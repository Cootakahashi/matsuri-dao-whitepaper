# ⛩️ Welcome to Matsuri Coin

> **Code for Harmony. Value for Peace.**
> A bridge of "Wa" in a fractured world. MTC is the compass that leads from competition to co-creation.

**Matsuri Coin (MTC)** is a decentralized utility token built on the Solana blockchain.
Designed as a **"Culture OS,"** it connects Japan's spiritual heritage — "Deep Japan" — to the global economy.

We're not building just another payment rail.
We're building a **bridge between Japan and the world** — a new co-creation framework where people who love culture join hands across borders.

## 🎯 Our Mission

:::info Channelling ¥10 Trillion of Market Energy into the Future of Culture
Japan's inbound tourism market is surging toward **¥10 trillion** per year.
But beneath that headline lies an **inconvenient truth.**
:::

### The Problems No One Talks About

| Problem | What's Really Happening |
| :--- | :--- |
| 💸 **Revenue Drain** | The lion's share of inbound revenue leaks overseas as commissions to foreign OTAs and intermediaries |
| 😤 **Community Burnout** | Over-tourism floods local areas with crowds, yet none of the profits flow back to the communities bearing the burden |
| 🚧 **The Experience Wall** | Package tours only scratch the surface — travellers never connect with the *real* Japan |

> **"Locals struggle, travellers see a facade, and the wealth vanishes into platform fees."**

We're using Web3 to dismantle this broken system.
Your payment reaches local communities and heritage preservation **directly** — fully transparent, zero middlemen.

## 🏗️ The Hybrid Model: Culture × Technology

Most crypto projects chase profit and treat culture as disposable.
MTC flips the script: we build an **"economy that protects culture"** — the hybrid structure that should have existed from day one.

| Pillar | What It Means |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🛕 Harmony & Preservation** | Tourist payments flow through blockchain rails directly to cultural preservation and artisan support. Communities (GCF) retain sovereignty over their own heritage — no extractive middlemen |
| **🌍 Global Connection** | Infrastructure that lets anyone, anywhere, support the Japanese spirit of "Wa." Holding MTC means sharing in Japan's living history — you become part of its story |

## ⚡ Why Solana?

Serving both "real tourism demand" and "high-frequency financial trading" left us with exactly **one viable blockchain.**

| Metric | Ethereum | Solana |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **Transaction Fee** | ¥100s–¥1,000s | **~¥0.04** |
| **Finality** | 12 s – minutes | **0.4 seconds** |
| **Throughput** | ~15 TPS | **Thousands of TPS** |

:::tip The Temple-Offering Test
A micro-payment as small as "tossing ¥100 into an offering box" demands fees **under ¥1.** Only Solana passes that test.

:::note Ready to Begin
MTC ends the era of tourism that merely *consumes* culture. Welcome to the journey of **co-creation** — let's build the future together.
